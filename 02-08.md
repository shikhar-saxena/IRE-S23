Cater for an **Information Need** implies answering a query.

To make *relevant information* emerge automatically from a large collection of documents using a **loose query formalism** to satisfy users **information need**.

Assumptions: The collection is static largely in nature.

Loose query formalism basically means even if the user doesn't know what to search still the user should be able to get the right results. Essentially a loose query should also be supported.
