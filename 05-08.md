- IR
    - Given a query return all relevant documents from a large collection
- Data Mining
    - From a large collection of single/multi source documents, retrieve insightful patterns and cues
    - Data Mining includes IR
- Big Data
    - Performing retrieval or mining tasks on a very large collection of data, which requires large compute
- NLP
    - Methods to process natural language, which aid to retrieval or mining
- ML
    - Process of applying algorithms that teach machines how to automatically learn and improve from experience

# Core Issues in IR

- Relevance 
    - of information retrieved
- Evaluation
    - Measures for comparing system output with user expectations 
    - Recall and precision are two examples of effective measures

## Issues with incidence matrix

Sparse matrices. Not a good way to store

## Indexing

Process that makes a document collections searchable.
