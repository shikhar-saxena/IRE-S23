# Documents as vectors

Each document can be represented as a vector where each dimension is a word in our vocabulary. These are very sparse vectors tho (most entries are zero).

# Modeling Proximity

- Euclidean Distance?
    - Doesn't provide a good metric in this case.
- angle (as distance)?
    - zero angle means maximum similarity
    - Doesn't take the magnitude of vectors into account
- cosine distance
    - ranking in decreasing order of angle => increasing order of cosine distance
    - since cosine is monotonically decreasing from $(0, \pi)$.

We have seen that we care more about the directionality of vector than say it's magnitude. So we can normalize each vector to be a unit vector. Then we can compute cosine distance very easily.

$$
cos(\mathbb{q}, \mathbb{d}) = \frac{\mathbb{q} \cdot \mathbb{d}}{|\mathbb{q}||\mathbb{d}|}
$$ 

Thus, for unit vectors it just reduces to a dot product.
